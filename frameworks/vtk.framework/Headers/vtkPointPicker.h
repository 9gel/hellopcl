// .NAME vtkPointPicker - select a point by shooting a ray into a graphics window
// .SECTION Description

// vtkPointPicker is used to select a point by shooting a ray into a graphics
// window and intersecting with actor's defining geometry - specifically its
// points. Beside returning coordinates, actor, and mapper, vtkPointPicker
// returns the id of the point projecting closest onto the ray (within the
// specified tolerance).  Ties are broken (i.e., multiple points all
// projecting within the tolerance along the pick ray) by choosing the point
// closest to the ray.
//

// .SECTION See Also
// vtkPicker vtkCellPicker.
