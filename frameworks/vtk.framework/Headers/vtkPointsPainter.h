// .NAME vtkPointsPainter - this painter paints verts.
// .SECTION Description
// This painter tries to paint points efficiently. Request to Render
// any other primitive are ignored and not passed to the delegate painter,
// if any. This painter cannot handle cell colors/normals. If they are
// present the request is passed on to the Delegate painter. If this
// class is able to render the primitive, the render request is not
// propagated to the delegate painter.
