// .NAME vtkFastNumericConversion - Enables fast conversion of floating point to fixed point
// .SECTION Description
// vtkFastNumericConversion uses a portable (assuming IEEE format) method for
// converting single and double precision floating point values to a fixed
// point representation. This allows fast integer floor operations on
// platforms, such as Intel X86, in which CPU floating point conversion
// algorithms are very slow. It is based on the techniques described in Chris
// Hecker's article, "Let's Get to the (Floating) Point", in Game Developer
// Magazine, Feb/Mar 1996, and the techniques described in Michael Herf's
// website, http://www.stereopsis.com/FPU.html.  The Hecker article can be
// found at http://www.d6.com/users/checker/pdfs/gdmfp.pdf.  Unfortunately,
// each of these techniques is incomplete, and doesn't convert properly, in a
// way that depends on how many bits are reserved for fixed point fractional
// use, due to failing to properly account for the default round-towards-even
// rounding mode of the X86. Thus, my implementation incorporates some
// rounding correction that undoes the rounding that the FPU performs during
// denormalization of the floating point value. Note that the rounding affect
// I'm talking about here is not the effect on the fistp instruction, but
// rather the effect that occurs during the denormalization of a value that
// occurs when adding it to a much larger value. The bits must be shifted to
// the right, and when a "1" bit falls off the edge, the rounding mode
// determines what happens next, in order to avoid completely "losing" the
// 1-bit. Furthermore, my implementation works on Linux, where the default
// precision mode is 64-bit extended precision.

// This class is contributed to VTK by Chris Volpe of Applied Research
// Associates, Inc.  (My employer requires me to say that -- CRV)

// This code assumes that the FPU is in round-to-nearest mode. It assumes, on
// Linux, that the default extended precision mode is in effect, and it
// assumes, on Windows, that the default double precision mode is in effect.

  // Description:
  // Small amount to use as a rounding tie-breaker to prevent
  // round-to-nearest-and-even mode from flooring-down odd numbered
  // integers. But number to nudge by depends on number of bits mantissa in
  // our floating point representation minus number of mantissa bits in the
  // range of signed ints we need to handle. In order to ensure that
  // flooring-down doesn't happen even for very large odd-integer values, the
  // number of bits used to represent the tie-breaker (i.e. to the right of
  // the binary-point), plus the number of bits needed to represent the
  // integer (to the left of the binary point), can not exceeds the number of
  // bits in the current precision mode. Thus, in selecting the tie-breaker
  // value, we select the largest number of bits to the right of the binary
  // point as possible while still maintaining that inequality. Thus, extended
  // precision mode allows a larger number of bits to the right of the binary
  // point.  This, in turn, implies a smaller value of the tie-breaker. And a
  // smaller tie-breaker will impose a tighter window on the range of values
  // that are erroneously rounded-up by a floor operation. Under double
  // precision, a QuickFloor of 0.9999998 (six 9's and an 8) correctly yields
  // 0. A value must be very close to 1.0, in fact, at least as close as
  // 0.9999999 (seven 9's)in order for the tie-breaker to bump it up to 1.
  // Under extended precision, an even smaller tie-breaker can be used. In
  // this mode, a QuickFloor of 0.9999999999 (ten 9's) correctly yields 0. A
  // QuickFloor of 0.99999999999 (eleven 9's) gets rounded up to 1. Since
  // these spurious round-ups occur only when the given value is virtually
  // indistinguishable from the next higher integer, the results should be
  // acceptable in most situations where performance is of the essence.

  // the x86 FPU does round() by default, is to define floor(x) as
  // round(x-.5).  This would work fine except for the fact that the x86 FPU
  // breaks rounding ties by selecting the even number. Thus, floor(4.0) =
  // round(3.5) = 4, but floor(3.0) = round(2.5) = 2. As a result,
  // subtracting .5 gives the wrong answer for odd integers. So, let's
  // subtract just a TEENSY bit less than .5, to swing the odd-integer
  // results up to their corect value. How teensy? Well, if it's too teensy,
  // it will be insignificant compared to 0.5, and will become equivalent to
  // 0.5.  And if it's not teensy enough, we'll overshoot, causing results
  // like floor(N-epsilon)==N, for some epsilon. Furthermore, the "too
  // teensy" problem is exacerbated when trying to floor larger numbers, due
  // to limitations of the representation's dynamic range. See the definition
